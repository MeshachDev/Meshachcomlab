// Cartons Break-Up
/*
A company manufactures packing cartons in 4 sizes i.e. cartons to accommodate 6 boxes,12 boxes,24 boxes, 48 boxes. Design a 
program to accept the number of boxes to be packed (N) by the user (max upto 1000 boxes) 
and display the break-up of cartons used in descending order of capacity 
(i.e. preference should be given to the highest capacity available and if boxes
are left are less than 6 an extra carton of capacity of 6 should be used. )
Example 1 Input N = 726 
Output: 48*15 = 720 
6*1 = 6
Remaining boxes = 0
Total number of boxes = 726 
Total number of cartons = 16
